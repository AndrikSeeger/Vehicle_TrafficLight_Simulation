# Stop-Roll-Go â€“ traffic light and vehicle drive simulation in ASCET
This project is a graphical implementation of a vehicle and track simulation using ASCET. The track profile is a combination of city and country roads with traffic lights. The simulation of the driver strategy is based on the optimization for a preferably constant speed without having to stop for a yellow or red light.

## Execution
To execute the application you should follow these steos: 

1. Download the project's ZIP-archive.
2. Unzip the archive and import the project to your workspace in ASCET.
3. Start the PC-App as your new experiment.
4. Use the attached experiment environment to monitor the data during the program execution. It's location is `TrafficLightProject\experiments\Experiments\system\PC_Final`.

## Experiment environment
The provided experiment environment is displayed in the following picture. It shows the acceleration phase after a forced stop.
